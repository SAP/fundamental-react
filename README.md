## Description

The `fundamental-react` library is a set of [React](https://reactjs.org/) components built using [SAP Fundamental Styles](https://sap.github.io/fundamental-styles/).

The SAP Fundamental Styles library is a design system and HTML/CSS component library used to build modern product user experiences with the SAP look and feel.

## API Reference

See [Component Documentation](https://sap.github.io/fundamental-react/) for examples and API details.

## Requirements

You will need to install [Node and Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

## Getting Started

For an existing react application, follow the steps below:

1. Install `fundamental-react`.

    ```
    npm install fundamental-react
    ```

1. As some components are currently packaged together with their respective `scss`, you will need to edit your webpack configuration to handle these files. See [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader).

1. Load the `fundamental-styles` styles. This is now packaged as a dependency with `fundamental-react`. If using create-react-app, this will be in `App.css`.

    ```css
    @import '~fundamental-styles/scss/fundamental-styles-ie11.css';
    ```

    > **NOTE:** Once all components are packaged with their respective `scss`, this step will not be needed.

1. Import components as needed. See [Component Documentation](https://sap.github.io/fundamental-react/) for examples and API details.
    ```javascript
    import { Alert } from 'fundamental-react/Alert';
    ```
    or
    ```javascript
    import { Alert } from 'fundamental-react';
    ```

    > **NOTE:** Importing from specific component is recommended. Doing so will bring in only the component you are using instead of the whole library, which will reduce your bundle size significantly.



## Versioning

The `fundamental-react` library follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). These components strictly adhere to the `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]` numbering system (also known as `[BREAKING].[FEATURE].[FIX]`).

Merges to the `master` branch will be published as a prerelease. Prereleases will include an **rc** version (_e.g._ `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]-rc.[RC]`).
