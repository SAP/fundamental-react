## Description

The `fundamental-react` library is a set of [React](https://reactjs.org/) components built using [SAP Fundamental Styles](https://sap.github.io/fundamental-styles/).

The SAP Fundamental Styles library is a design system and HTML/CSS component library used to build modern product user experiences with the SAP look and feel.

## API Reference

See [Component Documentation](https://sap.github.io/fundamental-react/) for examples and API details.

## Requirements

You will need to install [Node and Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

## Getting Started

For an existing react application, follow the steps below:

1. Install `fundamental-react`.

    ```
    npm install fundamental-react
    ```

1. All components are currently packaged together with their respective `css`, you will need to edit your webpack configuration to handle these files. See [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader).

1. Import components as needed. See [Component Documentation](https://sap.github.io/fundamental-react/) for examples and API details.
    ```javascript
    import { MessageStrip } from 'fundamental-react/MessageStrip';
    ```
    or
    ```javascript
    import { MessageStrip } from 'fundamental-react';
    ```

    > **NOTE:** Importing from specific component is recommended. Doing so will bring in only the component you are using instead of the whole library, which will reduce your bundle size significantly.


1. This project does not contain fonts and icons - they must be added to your project separately. Fonts and icons can be found at [`@sap-theming/theming-base-content`](https://github.com/SAP/theming-base-content). After importing fonts and icons from [`@sap-theming/theming-base-content`](https://github.com/SAP/theming-base-content), add the following to your css:

```
    @font-face {
        font-family: "72";
        src: url("path/to/fonts") format("woff"); // Bold, Light, Regular available in woff and woff2
        font-weight: normal;
        font-style: normal;
    };

    @font-face {
        font-family: "SAP-icons";
        src: url("path/to/icons") format("woff"); // available in woff, woff2 and ttf
        font-weight: normal;
        font-style: normal;
    }
```

Additionally, edit your webpack configuration to load font and icon fonts - see [file-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/file-loader/).

## Versioning

The `fundamental-react` library follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). These components strictly adhere to the `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]` numbering system (also known as `[BREAKING].[FEATURE].[FIX]`).

Merges to the `master` branch will be published as a prerelease. Prereleases will include an **rc** version (_e.g._ `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]-rc.[RC]`).
